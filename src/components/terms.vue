                projects at the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Chalmers and the University
                of Gothenburg are granted the right of using your application for research, but not commercial,
                purposes. Research use could include testing the application with a large user group, or
                investigating its effect on learning and explore further improvements of its core concept.

                developed or commissioned, or may develop in the future, materials similar to the participantsâ€™
                work. Participants waive any and all claims they may have resulting from any similarities
                between their creations and any such materials.
